This repo contains the evaluation code for the NeurIPS-24 paper "[MMLU-Pro: A More Robust and Challenging Multi-Task Language Understanding Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01574.pdf)"

## Introduction
We introduce MMLU-Pro, an enhanced benchmark designed to evaluate language understanding models across broader and more challenging tasks. Building on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset, MMLU-Pro integrates more challenging, reasoning-focused questions and increases the answer choices per question from four to ten, significantly raising the difficulty and reducing the chance of success through random guessing. MMLU-Pro comprises over 12,000 rigorously curated questions from academic exams and textbooks, spanning 14 diverse domains including Biology, Business, Chemistry, Computer Science, Economics, Engineering, Health, History, Law, Math, Philosophy, Physics, Psychology, and Others.  

Our experimental results show that MMLU-Pro not only raises the challenge, causing a significant drop in accuracy by 16% to 33% compared to MMLU but also demonstrates greater stability under varying prompts. With 24 different prompt styles tested, the sensitivity of model scores to prompt variations decreased from 4-5% in MMLU to just 2% in MMLU-Pro. Additionally, we found that models utilizing Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning achieved better performance on MMLU-Pro compared to direct answering, which starkly contrasts the findings on the original MMLU, indicating that MMLU-Pro includes more complex reasoning questions.

## Updates
**October 10, 2024**: Added the 24 tested prompt styles from the paper to the repository.

## Dataset Creation
MMLU-Pro was created to provide language models with a more challenging and robust benchmark, pushing the boundaries of what these models can achieve in terms of expert-level knowledge and reasoning. Please refer to our huggingface [**ü§ó Dataset**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro) for more details.

## Evaluation

To run local inference, modify the model name in the following script and execute it:

```bash
cd scripts/examples/
sh eval_llama_2_7b.sh
```

To use the API for inference, modify the API KEY in evaluate_from_api.py script and execute the bash script:

```bash
cd scripts/examples/
sh eval_gpt_4.sh
```

## Benchmarking Answer Extraction
We provide different alternatives to do answer extraction. We found that different answer extraction mechanisms have minor impact on the results.
