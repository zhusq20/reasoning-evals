Alicia bikes at 18 miles per hour, and Beth bikes at 12 miles per hour.\n## Step 3:  The relative speed at which they are approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds, which is $18 + 12 = 30$ miles per hour.\n## Step 4:  Since they are initially 45 miles apart, we can use the formula for distance, which is $distance = speed \\times time$.
